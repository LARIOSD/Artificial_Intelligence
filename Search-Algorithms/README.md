  This folder contains some search algorithms like..
  
| **Algorithms** :computer: |
| ------------ |
| :zero: **[Breadth First Search (BFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)**  |
| :one: **[Depth First Search (DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)**  |
| :two: **[Depth First Search Iterative (DFS-I)]()** |
| :three: **[A\* Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)** |
| :four: **[Greedy Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm)** |

In order **to use** the different algorithms **go to** the **main function** and you will see the comments. There are also different graphs to implement.
