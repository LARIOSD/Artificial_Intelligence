Here are some programs made with p5.js related to artificial intelligence. Some of them are not finished yet. Some of these programs are based on The Coding Train.

## [MazeGenerator](https://github.com/kmilo9713/Web-IA/tree/master/Maze%20Generator)
  This algorithm makes a new maze each time it runs. It uses the maze generation algorithm, you can find some information about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm).
  
## [GeneticAlgorithm](https://github.com/kmilo9713/Web-IA/tree/master/Genetic%20Algorithm)
  This algorithm tries to get a string by evolving an initial population. I'll upload more examples about this topic overtime.
  
## [SteeringBehavior](https://github.com/kmilo9713/Web-IA/tree/master/SteeringBehavior)
  This algorithm is based in behaviors. Seek.

## [Subject-Unimag](https://github.com/kmilo9713/Web-IA/tree/master/Subject-Unimag)
  This folder contains different algorithms based in the subject Artificial Intelligence given by the Universidad del Magdalena,
  this folder is not related with the university, it just me trying to help people.

## ImportantStuff
  There are some examples that are not finished yet. If you want to clone one of my projects you can, but just let me know in a message what you made with it, I also want to learn more! =D

## Note
> If you want to help with some exercises or if I have any mistake or you want to improve an algorithm, please contact me!
> I will be uptading this repository with new exercises and comments in the code.
