Here are some programs made with p5.js related with artificial intelligence, some of them are not finished yet. Some of these programs are based on The Coding Train.

## MazeGenerator
  This algorithm makes a new maze each time it is run. It uses the maze generation algorithm, you can find some information about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm).
  
## GeneticAlgorithm
  This algorithm tries to get an string by evolving an initial population. I'll upload more examples about this topic over the time.
  
## ImportantStuff
  There are some examples that are not finished yet, if you want to clone one of my projects you can do it without problem but just let me know in a message what you made with it, I also want to learn more! =D
