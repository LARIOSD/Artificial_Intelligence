Here are some programs made with p5.js related to artificial intelligence. Some of them are not finished yet. Some of these programs are based on The Coding Train.

## MazeGenerator
  This algorithm makes a new maze each time it is run. It uses the maze generation algorithm, you can find some information about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm).
  
## GeneticAlgorithm
  This algorithm tries to get a string by evolving an initial population. I'll upload more examples about this topic overtime.
  
## ImportantStuff
  There are some examples that are not finished yet. If you want to clone one of my projects you can, but just let me know in a message what you made with it, I also want to learn more! =D
