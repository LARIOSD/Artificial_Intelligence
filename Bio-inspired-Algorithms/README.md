This folder contains bio-inspired algorithms like...

| :tw-30-20e3: **[Hill Climbing](https://github.com/kmilo9713/Web-IA/tree/master/Bio-inspired-Algorithms/hill_climbing)**  |
| :tw-31-20e3: **[Simulated Annealing](https://github.com/kmilo9713/Web-IA/tree/master/Bio-inspired-Algorithms/simulated_annealing)**  |
| :tw-32-20e3: **[Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/kmilo9713/Web-IA/tree/master/Bio-inspired-Algorithms/genetic_algorithm)** |
| :tw-33-20e3: **[Ant Colony](https://github.com/kmilo9713/Web-IA/tree/master/Bio-inspired-Algorithms/ant_colony)** |

These algorithms solve **The Knapsack Problem** but the objects are **sheeps** and they are organized in two archives .txt:
- sheep_list_range2_500_arc5b.txt (**500 sheeps**)
- sheep_list_range2_1000_arc5b.txt (**1000 sheeps**)

> Note: Each algorithm has its own instructions and parameters. They are described in their respectives READMEs.
