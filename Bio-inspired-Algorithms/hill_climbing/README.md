# Hill Climbing Algorithm
  
  ## Made with Python
  [![Python](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/devcodepro/media/blog/por-que-aprender-python.png "Python")](http://https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/devcodepro/media/blog/por-que-aprender-python.png "Python")

These algorithms solve **The Knapsack Problem** but the objects are **sheeps** and they are organized in two archives .txt:
- sheep_list_range2_500_arc5b.txt (**500 sheeps**)
- sheep_list_range2_1000_arc5b.txt (**1000 sheeps**)

### How to use
This algorithm counts with two parameters and they are:
* The path where the information is located. [--doc]
* The limit weight for the problem. [--peso]
* The number of restarts the algorithm will have. (The algorithm will give the best found solution in all the runs) [--runs]
* A boolean which will indicate if more information in the process should be done. [--verb]
> If you don't give the parameters in the line command, the algorithm will work with default values.
### Example
```sh
$ python3 ovejas_hill_climbing.py --peso 1000 --doc ../sheep_list_range2_1000_arc5b.txt --runs 5
```
